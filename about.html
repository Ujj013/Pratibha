            India is a land of colours. Everywhere we go, we find a rich and dazzling mixture of art and aesthetics, customs, traditions and culture. Ours is a land replete with a kaleidoscopic blend of traditional as well as modern art, which reflects the diversity and richness of this country. Thus, it is not a surprising fact that India is one of the most sought-after destinations of handicrafts in the world. The term ‘handicraft’ essentially entails processing materials manually, or with the help of basic tools to create useful or decorative products. This includes needlework and textiles, tribal crafts, festive decorations, accessories and even eco-friendly products. The amount of skill, patience and precision that goes into the making of these beautiful pieces is commendable.
            <br><br>
            The Indian handicrafts industry contains around 7 million artisans and 67000 exporters, who promote regional art and craftsmanship in domestic and global markets. These artisans generally comprise of women and people belonging to the rural sections of the population. In other words, this industry employs a number of people from the weaker sections of the society, who otherwise face a lot of trouble in trying to find jobs. It is notable that India enjoys 2% share in handmade products at the global level. This industry accounts for a major share in the country’s exports, where trade in these products is carried out with countries such as USA, Canada, UK, France, Italy, Australia, the UAE, the Latin American Countries and many others. The Export Promotion Council for Handicrafts is that body of the government that caters to handicraft trade from India. It falls under the Ministry of Textiles, and what sets it apart from other government bodies is that it self-finances most of its promotional activities.

            Among the most famous handicrafts of India are Pashmina shawls from Kashmir. The material used is a type of delicate cashmere wool, and the all the steps involved in the making of these shawls, from weaving, spinning and combing is done by hand, which is what makes these shawls extremely exquisite and expensive. The characteristic features of these shawls include vibrant and vivid hues, intricate embroidery and a unique kind of softness and warmth. West Bengal, Bihar and Assam are famous for jute handicrafts, which are renowned worldwide. These range from bags to footwear, jewellery, wall hangings, accessories and a plethora of other items. They are extremely affordable, attractive and eco-friendly.

            The northern states of India have a wondrous legacy of woodwork. Walnut and pine trees in Kashmir and other mountainous regions are used to fashion toys, furniture and sculptures. Punjab is also famous for its ‘phulkaris’, which are embroidered scarfs and napkins that are intricate, bright and colourful. Uttar Pradesh is known for its ‘zardozi’ embroidery, which involves embroidering complex designs using gold and silver threads. This is just a small glimpse of the myriad and diverse handicrafts that belong to the various parts of the country.
            <br><br>
            I recently visited the ‘Hastashilpa Mela’, one of the most renowned handicraft fairs of Kolkata, which has been carrying forward the legacy of indigenous handicrafts since almost 30 years in the city. On interacting with some of the exhibitors and sellers at the fair, I got a lot of insight into the making and selling of these products. What struck me the most was the tremendous amount of variety in the products that were being displayed, and the rock bottom prices at which they were being sold. From furniture to paintings, show pieces, accessories, shoes, bags, textiles, pottery; they had an endless number of items on sale.
            <br><br>
            All the more amazing was the materials they had used; from wood, cane and terracotta artefacts and straw dolls, to sculptures carved from the horns of bulls; the sheer creativity had me mesmerized. We could see the artisans fashioning their products at their exhibits themselves, and it was very interesting to see the methods and skills employed by these people. Many of the exhibitors were from different parts of India, and had displayed their wares at different fairs in the country. There were a number of visitors, from various age groups and overall the experience was memorable.
            <br><br>
            In the face of high-end shopping malls, international brands and imported products, our indigenous handicrafts are not only unique and appealing to the eye, but also provide a boost to the national economy.
